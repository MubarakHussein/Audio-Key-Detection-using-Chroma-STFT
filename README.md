# Audio Key Detection using Chroma STFT

This Python script estimates the musical key of an audio file using the Chroma Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) feature. The script processes the audio file, computes its chroma features, and identifies the most likely musical key.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `librosa` (for audio processing)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
